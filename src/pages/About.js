      <h2>About UniThrift</h2>
      <p>
        UniThrift is a green, student focused marketplace. Sellers keep 95 percent, 
        payments are secure, listings are limited to a 15 mile radius so buyers can 
        shop nearby campuses.
      </p>
      <p>
        We prevent off platform deals by hiding contact info until after purchase, 
        which keeps buyers and sellers protected.
      </p>
      <p>
        We also hire Student Movers so students can earn on the side by helping others.
